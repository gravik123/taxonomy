 Part II 

 II. Information and Guidelines for Specific Transaction Types 

This part of Your Payments Acceptance Guide reviews essential elements of a Transaction, including Authorisations, issuing refunds and exchanges, and handling special Transactions like recurring payments. You’ll also find information about Chargebacks and processes to put in place to help avoid Chargebacks. Feel free to contact the Fiserv Customer Support Hotline with any questions that arise as you review this information. 

 7. Authorisations 

 General 

 • You must obtain an Authorisation approval code for all Transactions
 • An Authorisation approval code only indicates the availability of funds on an account at the time the

 • Follow the prompts on the Fiserv provided terminal screen, do not deviate from the prompts or ignore Authorisation is requested. It does not indicate that the person presenting the Card is the rightful Cardholder, nor is it a promise or guarantee that you will not be subject to a Chargeback or adjustment. not take alternative measures with the same Card to obtain an approval of the sale from other sources. Request another form of payment instead. decline (even if a subsequent Authorisation attempt results in an Authorisation approval code), your Transaction may result in a Chargeback not the Transaction is approved approval code the Authorisation response received
 Card-Not-Present Transactions 

You will need to obtain the three-digit Card verification code (reflected on the back of the Card) and include this code with each Card-not-present Authorisation request unless the Transaction is a recurring Transaction. 

For recurring Transactions, submit the Card verification code only with the first Authorisation request and not with subsequent Authorisation requests. 

You should not store Card verification codes. 

 Transaction Processing 

The following general requirements apply to all Debit Card Transactions: 

 • All debit Transactions must be authorised and processed electronically
 • You may not complete a Debit Card Transaction that has not been authorised. If you cannot obtain an Authorisation at the time of sale, you should request another form of payment from the customer or process the Transaction as a Store and Forward or Resubmission, in which case you assume the risk that the Transaction fails to authorise or otherwise decline.
 • For a declined Transaction, the Cardholder should be instructed to contact the Issuer to find out why
 • Debit Card Transactions must be completed either with a Personal Identification Number (PIN) or without PIN by getting the Cardholder to sign on chargeslip or through means of a contactless “tap and go” method
 • Where a PIN must be entered, it must be entered into the PIN pad only by the Cardholder. You cannot accept the PIN from the Cardholder verbally or in written form.
 • You must provision for and offer to issue a receipt to the Cardholder upon successful completion of a Transaction
 • The Cardholder account number will be masked so that only the part of the account number 

(For example, first six and last three digits) will appear. The masked digits will appear as a non-numeric character such as an asterisk. This is referred to as PAN truncation.
 • You may not manually enter the account number. The account number must be read electronically from either the Chip or the magnetic stripe which is used in the event of “technical fallback” when the terminal cannot interact with the Chip.
 • If the magnetic stripe is also unreadable, you must request another form of payment from the Cardholder
 • Any applicable tax (for example, GST) must be included in the total Transaction amount for which Authorisation is requested. Tax may not be collected separately in cash.
 • You are responsible to secure your terminals, terminal passwords and change to its default passwords and to institute appropriate controls to prevent employees or others from submitting Refunds and voids that do not reflect bona fide returns or reimbursements of prior Transactions
 • You must not store any PIN and you must securely store any account information to prevent unauthorised access, use or disclosure
 8. Special Types of Transactions 

 Payment by Instalments 

If a Cardholder makes a deposit toward the full amount of the sale price and pays the balance on delivery, please follow the procedures set out in this section. 

 Dos 

 Don’ts 

 • Submit and seek Authorisation of each delayed delivery Transaction under the same merchant identification number and treat deposits on the Card no differently than you treat deposits on all other payment products
 • Execute two separate Transactions and obtain an Authorisation for each on each Transaction date
 • Obtain proof of delivery upon delivery of the services/merchandise purchased
 • Don’t submit a final Transaction to us relating to the “balance” until the goods have been completely delivered or the services fully provided
 Recurring Transactions 

If you process recurring Transactions and charge a Cardholder’s account periodically for goods or services (For example, yearly subscriptions, annual membership fees and so on) please follow the procedures set out in this section. 

 Dos 

 Don’ts 

 • Obtain written Cardholder approval for goods or services to be charged on a recurring basis to the Cardholder’s account. Approval must at least specify: 
	• The Cardholder’s name, address, account number and expiration date
 • Include the recurring payment indicator in each Authorisation request, and as applicable, each batch submission entry 
	• The Transaction amounts
	• The timing or frequency of recurring charges
	• The duration of time for which the Cardholder’s approval is granted
 • Obtain an Authorisation for each Transaction
 • Don’t include partial payments for goods or services purchased in a single Transaction
 • Don’t impose a finance charge in connection with the recurring Transaction or preauthorised order
 • Don’t complete a recurring Transaction after receiving a cancellation notice from the Cardholder or Card issuing bank or after a request for Authorisation has been denied

It is highly recommended that you obtain the three-digit Card verification code on the back of the Card and include the number with the first Authorisation request. This is not required for subsequent Authorisation requests. 

You should not store Card verification codes. 

A positive Authorisation response for one recurring Transaction is not a guarantee that any future recurring Transaction Authorisation request will be approved or paid. 

If the recurring Transaction is renewed, you must obtain from the Cardholder a new written request for the continuation of such goods or services to be charged to the Cardholder’s account. 

If you or Fiserv have terminated your right to accept Cards, you must not submit Authorisation requests or Transactions for recurring Transactions due after the date of such termination. 

 Stored Payment Credentials 

If you store information (including, but not limited to, an account number or payment token) to process future purchases on behalf of the Cardholder, follow the procedures set out in this section. 

 Dos 

 • Do include the appropriate data values when a payment credential is being used to initiate a stored
 • Do include the appropriate data values when a payment credential is being used to identify an Don’ts credential Transaction unscheduled credentials on file Transaction
 • Do include the appropriate data values when a payment credential is being stored for the first time
 • Do submit an Authorisation verification if no payment is due at the time the payment credential is being stored
 • Do submit a valid Authorisation if an amount is due at the time the payment credential is being stored
 • Don’t store a payment credential if either the first payment Transaction or account verification is declined
 9. Refunds 

 Dos 

 • For e-commerce, do add a “tick box” or acceptance confirmation so the Cardholder acknowledges the terms and conditions of the sale they are entering into prior to complete the checkout
 • Provide clear instructions to your customers regarding returns, including the following 
	• Customer service telephone number
	• Reference number for the return
	• Expected processing time for the credit
	• Return address, preferably on a pre-formatted shipping label (if applicable)
 • Do document your cancellation policy as applicable to local laws
 • Do provide full Refunds for the exact dollar amount of the original Transaction including goods and services tax and in no circumstances provide a Refund amount for more than the original sale amount
 Don’ts 

 • Don’t provide a Refund amount for more than the original sale amount
 • Don’t credit an account that differs from the account used for the original Transaction
 • Don’t give cash, cheque or other consideration for Card sales
 • Don’t intentionally submit a sale and an offsetting credit at a later date solely for the purpose of debiting and crediting your own or a customer’s account
 • Don’t process a Refund after a Chargeback has been received

Your website must communicate your refund policy to your customers with the prudent practice of seeking your customers to select a “click-to-accept” or another affirmative button to acknowledge the policy. 

Display the terms and conditions of the purchase on the same screen view as the checkout screen that presents the total purchase amount, or within the sequence of website pages the Cardholder accesses during the checkout process. 

 10. Chargebacks, Retrievals and Other Debits 

 Chargebacks 

Both the Cardholder and the Card issuing bank have the right to question or dispute a Transaction. If such questions or disputes are not resolved, a Chargeback may occur. You are responsible for all Chargebacks, our Chargeback fees and related costs arising from your Transactions. As a result, we will debit your settlement account for the amount of each Chargeback. 

Due to the short time frames and the supporting documentation necessary to successfully (and permanently) reverse a Chargeback in your favour, we strongly recommend that: 

 • You adhere to the guidelines and procedures outlined in this guide
 • Investigate if you receive a Chargeback, submit the appropriate documentation within the required time frame if you dispute the Chargeback
 • Whenever possible, contact the Cardholder directly to resolve the dispute
 • If you have any questions, call the Fiserv Customer Support Hotline, contact your account manager or write to chargebacks@firstdatams.com

You must not process a credit Transaction (also known as a Refund) once a Chargeback is received, even with Cardholder Authorisation, as the credits may not be recoverable and you may be financially responsible for the credit as well as the Chargeback. Instead, the Card issuing bank will credit the Cardholder’s account. 

 Chargeback Process 

If the Card issuing bank submits a Chargeback, we will send you a Chargeback notification, which may also include a request for Transaction documentation. Due to the short time requirements imposed by the Card Schemes, it is important that you respond to a Chargeback notification request promptly and within the time frame set out in the notification. 

Upon receipt of a Transaction documentation request, you must immediately retrieve the requested Transaction receipt/sales draft(s) using the following guidelines: 

 • A legible copy
 • If applicable, make copies of a hotel folio, car rental agreement, mail/phone/Internet order form or other form of receipt
 • Submit supporting documentation in accordance with the instructions provided

If the information you provide is both timely and, in our sole discretion, sufficient to warrant a re-presentment of the Transaction or reversal of the Chargeback we will do so on your behalf. 

A re-presentment or reversal is ultimately contingent upon the Card issuing bank and/or Cardholder accepting the Transaction under applicable Card Schemes guidelines. Re-presentment or reversal is not a guarantee that the Chargeback has been resolved in your favour. 

If we do not receive a clear, legible and complete copy of the Transaction documentation within the timeframe specified on the request, you may be subject to a Chargeback for “non-receipt” for which there is no recourse. 

If you do not dispute the Chargeback within the applicable time limits as set by the Card Schemes rules and regulations, you will forfeit your reversal rights. 

If we reverse the Chargeback and re-present the Transaction to the Card issuing bank, the Card issuing bank, at its sole discretion, may elect to submit the matter for arbitration before the applicable Card Scheme. The Card Scheme may charge a filing fee and a review fee. Whether or not a decision is made in your favour, you will be responsible for all such fees, charges and any other applicable fees and charges imposed by the Card Scheme. Such fees and charges will be debited from your settlement account in addition to the Chargeback. 

 Sample Chargeback Reasons 

The following outlines the most common types of Chargebacks. This list is not exhaustive. We have included recommendations on how to reduce the risk of Chargebacks. These are recommendations only and do not guarantee that you will eliminate Chargebacks. 

 Chargebacks Due to Authorisation Description 

Proper Authorisation procedures were not followed and valid Authorisation was not obtained. 

 Likely Scenario 

 • Authorisation not obtained
 • Authorisation was declined
 • Transaction processed with an expired Card and Authorisation was not obtained
 • Transaction processed with an invalid account number and Authorisation was not obtained
 Recommendations to Reduce Risk of Chargeback 

 • Obtain valid Authorisation on the day of the Transaction 
	• If you receive a decline response, request another form of payment
 Chargebacks Due to Cancellation and Returns Description 

Credit was not processed properly or the Cardholder has cancelled or returned items. 

 Likely scenario 

 • Cardholder received damaged or defective merchandise
 • Cardholder continued to be billed for cancelled recurring Transaction
 • Credit Transaction was not processed
 Recommendations to Reduce Risk of Chargeback 

 • Issue credit to the Cardholder on the same account as the purchase in a timely manner
 • Do not issue credit to the Cardholder in the form of cash, cheque or in-store/merchandise credit as we may not be able to recoup your funds if the Transaction is charged back
 • For recurring Transactions ensure customers are fully aware of the conditions 


	• Cancel recurring Transactions as soon as notification is received from the Cardholder or as a Chargeback, issue the appropriate credit as needed to the Cardholder in a timely manner; and
 • Provide proper disclosure of your refund policy for returned/cancelled merchandise or services to the Cardholder at the time of Transaction. Card present, Cardholder signed the sales draft containing disclosure
 • For e-commerce, provide disclosure on your website on the same page as checkout
 • Ideally have the Cardholder to click to accept prior to completion
 Chargebacks Due to Fraud Description 

Transactions that the Cardholder claims are unauthorised; the account number is no longer in use or is fictitious, or the merchant was identified as “high risk.” 

Note: For Visa Transactions, to ensure that you preserve your Chargeback rights, you must: 

 • Complete a retrieval request and provide a sales slip that contains all required data elements; and
 • Respond to all retrieval requests with a clear legible copy of the Transaction document that contains all required data elements within the specified timeframe
 Likely Scenario 

 • Multiple Transactions were completed with a single Card without the Cardholder’s permission
 • A counterfeit Card was used and proper acceptance procedures were not followed
 • Authorisation was obtained; however, full track data was not transmitted
 • The Cardholder states that they did not authorise or participate in the Transaction
 Recommendations to Reduce the Risk of Chargeback Card Present Transactions 

 • Obtain an Authorisation for all Transactions
 • For recurring Transactions ensure customers are fully aware of the conditions
 • Cancel recurring Transactions as soon as notification is received from the Cardholder or as a Chargeback, and issue the appropriate credit as needed to the Cardholder in a timely manner 

You should avoid keying the Card data into your terminal unless you have been given Mail Order/Telephone Order (MO/TO) access and permission to do so
 Recommendations to Reduce the Risk of Chargeback Card-Not-Present Transactions 

 • Ensure delivery of the merchandise or services ordered to the Cardholder
 • Participate in recommended fraud mitigation tools 


	• Verified by Visa Program
	• Mastercard SecureCodeNote: While Transactions utilising these tools may still be disputed; the service may assist you with your decision to accept certain Cards for payment.
 • Obtain Authorisation for all Transactions
 • Ensure merchant descriptor matches the name of the business and is displayed correctly on the Cardholder statement
 • Ensure descriptor includes correct business address and a valid customer service number
 Chargebacks Due to Cardholder Disputes Description 

Goods or services not received by the Cardholder, merchandise defective or not as described. 

 Likely Scenario 

 • Services were not provided or merchandise was not received by the Cardholder
 • Cardholder was charged prior to merchandise being shipped or merchandise was not received by agreed upon delivery date or location 

Cardholder received merchandise that was defective, damaged or unsuited for the purpose sold or did not match the description on the Transaction documentation/verbal description presented at the time of purchase
 • Cardholder paid with an alternate means and their Card was also billed for the same Transaction
 • Cardholder cancelled service or merchandise and their Card was billed
 • Cardholder billed for a Transaction that was not part of the original Transaction document
 • Cardholder claims to have been sold counterfeit goods
 • Cardholder claims the merchant misrepresented the terms of sale
 Recommendations to Reduce Such Risk of Chargeback 

Provide services or merchandise as agreed upon and described to the Cardholder; clearly indicate the expected delivery date on the sales receipt or invoice 

Contact the Cardholder in writing if the merchandise or service cannot be provided or is delayed, and offer the Cardholder the option to cancel if your internal policies allow 

If the Cardholder received defective merchandise or the merchandise received was not as described; resolve the issue with the Cardholder at first contact 

If the merchandise is being picked up by the Cardholder, have them sign for the merchandise after inspecting that it was received in good condition 

 • If unable to provide services or merchandise, issue a credit to the Cardholder in a timely manner
 • Accept only one form of payment per Transaction. Ensure the Cardholder is only billed once per Transaction
 • Do not bill Cardholder for loss, theft or damages unless authorised by the Cardholder
 • Ensure that a description of the service or merchandise provided is clearly defined
 Chargebacks Due to Processing Errors Description 

Error was made when Transaction was processed or it was billed incorrectly. 

 Likely Scenario 

 • The Transaction was not deposited within the Card Scheme specified timeframe
 • The Cardholder was issued a credit however the Transaction was processed as a sale
 • The account number or Transaction amount used in the Transaction was incorrectly entered
 • A single Transaction was processed more than once to the Cardholder’s account
 • The Cardholder initially presented the Card as payment for the Transaction. However, the Cardholder decided to use an alternate form of payment.
 Recommendations to Reduce Risk of Chargeback 

 • Process all Transactions within the Card Scheme specified timeframes
 • Ensure all Transactions are processed accurately and only one time
 • If a Transaction was processed more than once, immediately issue voids, Transaction reversals or credits 

Ensure that credit Transaction receipts are processed as credits and sale Transaction receipts are processed as sales 

Ensure all Transactions received a valid Authorisation approval code prior to processing the Transaction 

Do not alter Transaction documentation or make any adjustments unless the Cardholder has been contacted and agrees to modifications of the Transaction amount 

Retain copies of all Transaction documentation for the required timeframe that is specified by each Card Scheme
 • Develop efficient methods to retrieve Transaction documentation to maximise ability to fulfil requests
 • Merchant should retain the Transaction documents for 13 months from the date of Transaction
 11. Suspect/Fraudulent Transactions 

If the Card being presented or the behaviour of the person presenting the Card appears to be suspicious or you otherwise suspect fraud, you must immediately contact the Fiserv Customer Support Hotline listed on Page 2 of this Guide. 

While not proof that a Transaction is fraudulent, the following are some suggestions to assist you in preventing fraudulent Transactions that could result in a Chargeback 

 Does the Cardholder: 

 • Appear nervous/agitated/hurried?
 • Insist on taking the merchandise immediately (for example, no matter how difficult it is to handle, is not interested in delivery, alterations and so on)?
 • Appear to be purchasing an unusual amount of expensive items or the same items?
 • Talk fast or carry on a conversation to distract you from checking Authorisation code obtained or where applicable, the signature? 

Repeatedly come back, in a short amount of time or right before closing time, to make additional purchases?
 • Take the Card from a pocket instead of a wallet?

Appear to be making indiscriminate purchases (for example, does not care how much an item costs, the size and so on)? 

Make purchases substantially greater than your usual customer (for example, your average Transaction is $60, but this Transaction is for $360)? 

Cause an unusual, sudden increase in the number and average sales Transactions over a one-to three- day period? 

 Does the Card: 

 • Have characters the same size, height, style and all within alignment?
 • Appear to be re-embossed (the original numbers or letters may be detected on the back of the Card)?
 • Have a hologram? Does it look damaged? Never accept a Card without the hologram
 • Have a Chip?
 • Have a magnetic stripe on the back on the Card?
 • Have an altered signature panel (for example, appear discoloured, glued or painted or show erasure marks on the surface)?
 • Have “valid from” (effective) and “valid thru” (expiration) dates consistent with the sale date?

We also recommend that you are vigilant for any Cardholder who behaves as follows, specifically in relation to prepaid Cards: 

 • Frequently makes purchases and then returns the goods for cash
 • Uses prepaid Cards to purchase other prepaid Cards
 • Uses large numbers of prepaid Cards to make purchase

 Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) 

 • Disclosures must happen when Dynamic Currency Conversion is offered and before the Cardholder is prompted to actively choose the Transaction currency
 • Merchants must utilise screens and/or receipts that are deemed compliant by the Cards associations in order to offer Dynamic Currency Conversion
 • As part of your initial implementation of Dynamic Currency Conversion your screens and receipts will be reviewed for compliance purposes by our Dynamic Currency Solutions Product Team. Additionally, any future changes to screens and/or receipts need to be reviewed by the Global Currency Solutions Product Team to ensure continued compliance with Card Scheme Rules.
 • There are explicit rules related to offering Dynamic Currency Conversion when utilising customer facing devices. Specifically: 


	• Offers cannot utilise different colored selection buttons such as RED/GREEN 
	
	Offer cannot utilise different font size or bold characters 
	
	Offer cannot contain YES/NO buttons. They may instead provide the offering in a neutral manner such as “Pay in EUR”/“Pay in USD”

 Steering 

 • It cannot be said often enough: The merchant must never steer a Cardholder to choose Dynamic Currency Conversion over the merchant’s base currency 

Based on guidance from the Card Schemes, steering can occur in many forms and are not necessarily obvious to merchants or their sales staff. Steering can appear as active or passive, but neither is permitted

In general, merchants should utilise caution and be aware of the following regulations when offering Dynamic Currency Conversion: 


The merchant must not use any language or procedure that would cause the Cardholder to choose Dynamic Currency Conversion by default 

The merchant must not us any language or procedure that may make paying in the merchant’s local currency difficult to understand 

The Cardholder must consent to opt in for each Dynamic Currency Conversion Transaction. Although for certain vertical markets such as travel and entertainment expenses, merchants may capture the Cardholder’s decision in advance and utilise this during their hotel stay, cruise trip or car rental.
