Card acceptance solutions are an essential part of your business. As your partner, we want to make accepting cards as simple as possible for you. That’s why we created Your Payments Acceptance Guide. It’s your quick reference to the guidelines for processing transactions. You’ll also find recommendations and tips to help you prevent fraud, reduce chargebacks, and properly handle payments, refunds, exchanges, and most other situations you’ll encounter in your day-to day-business. 

To help you navigate more easily and find the information you need when you need it, we’ve organized the guide into three parts. At the end of the guide, you’ll also find information specific to processing American Express and Discover payments. 

If you have questions about processing payments or any of your other business services, please contact Customer Service at the number listed on your merchant services statement. Your Customer Service team is here to make things easier so let us know what we can do to help.

The first step of a transaction actually begins before a customer even decides to make a purchase. This part of Your Payments Acceptance Guide reviews steps you’ll need to take to ensure customers are informed of their payment options and understand the terms of sale. You’ll also find tips and important reminders for validating cards in order to reduce the risk of fraud. Finally, specific procedures for accepting debit payments are outlined. If you have questions about anything discussed in this guide, please contact Customer Service at the number located on your merchant services statement and terminal. 

1 

## Use of Payments Organizations’ Brands 

### DO’S 

* • do prominently display relevant trademarks of the payment organizations at each of your locations, in catalogs, on websites and on other promotional material.
* • do only use the official trademarks of ours and of the payment organizations in the official format.
### DON’TS 

* • don’t indicate that we or any payment organization endorses your goods or services.
* • don’t use the trademarks of any payment organization after: your right to accept the cards of that payment organization has ended; or that payment organization has notified you to stop using their trademarks.
* • don’t use the trademarks of ours or of the payment organizations in any way that injures or diminishes the goodwill associated with the trademarks.
* • don’t use our trademarks or the trademarks of the payment organizations in any manner, including in any advertisements, displays, or press releases, without our prior written consent.
* • For special rules applying to the treatment of the American Express brand, please visit https://www.americanexpress. com/canada/.

## Point of Sale (POS) Reminders 

You must clearly and conspicuously: 

* • disclose all material terms of sale prior to obtaining an authorization;
* • at all points of interaction inform cardholders which entity is making the sales offer, so that the cardholders can clearly distinguish you from any other party involved in the interaction; and
* • disclose any discount/incentive for customers to pay with cash, check, credit card or debit card and so on. Any such discount/incentive must be offered to all customers with no special treatment for any card brand or card issuing bank.
* • do not set minimum or maximum transaction amounts for any credit or debit card
* • ensure you settle (balance) your terminals every day’

If you accept orders via the Internet, your website must include the following information in a prominent manner: 

* • a complete description of the goods or services offered;
* • details of your (i) delivery policy; (ii) consumer data privacy policy; (iii) cancellation policy; and (iv) returns policy;
* • the transaction currency (Canadian dollars, unless permission is otherwise received from Servicers);
* • the Customer Service contact, including email address and/or telephone number;
* • your address, including country;
* • the transaction security used on your website;
* • any applicable export or legal restrictions;
* • your identity at all points of interaction with the cardholder; and
* • the date on which any free trial period ends.

If you limit refund/exchange terms or impose other specific conditions for card sales, you must clearly print (in 1/4” letters) the words “No Exchange, No Refund,” etc. on the sales receipt near or above the cardholder’s signature, both on the cardholder’s copy and your copy. 

During a liquidation and/or closure of any of your outlets, locations and/or businesses, you must post signs clearly visible to customers stating that “All Sales Are Final,” and stamp the sales draft with a notice that “All Sales Are Final.”

## Validating the Cards 

Transactions where the cardholder is present - ‘Card Present’ transactions 

You must check the card if the cardholder is present at the point of sale: 

* • capture card data using the POS device by swiping the card (magnetic stripe), tapping the contactless card or inserting the chip card.
* • ensure that the cardholder either enters their PIN using the keypad or provides their signature;
* • verify that the signature is identical to the name and signature on the card (if a signature is provided);
* • verify the card’s valid from date (if applicable) and the expiration date;
* • verify that the card number and expiration date on the card are the same as on the trans action receipt and the number displayed on the POS device;
* • verify that the name on the transaction receipt is the same as the name on the front of the card (if applicable); and
* • ensure that the cardholder appears to be the person shown in the photograph (for cards with a photograph of the cardholder).

If the signature panel on the card is blank, you must: 

* • review positive identification bearing the cardholder’s signature (for example, a current passport or driver’s license) to validate the cardholder’s identity;
* • require the cardholder to sign the signature panel of the card prior to completing the transaction

Transactions where the cardholder is not present - ‘Card Not Present’ transactions 

This section applies to any transaction where the cardholder is not present, such as mail, telephone, Internet and E-commerce. 

You may only conduct Internet transactions if you have notified us in advance and received approval. 

### DO’S 

* • do obtain the card account number, name as it appears on the card, expiration date of the card, and the cardholder’s statement address.
* • do use the Address Verification Service (AVS). If you do not have AVS, contact Customer Service immediately.
* • do use the Card Security Code (CVV2/CVC2/CAV2/CID) verification service.
* • do clearly print the following on the sales receipt, and provide a copy to the cardholder at the time of delivery: 
	+ » the last four digits of the cardholder’s account number;
	+ » the date of transaction;
	+ » a description of the goods and services;
	+ » the amount of the transaction (including shipping, handling, insurance, etc.);
	+ » the cardholder’s name, billing address and shipping address;
	+ » the authorization code;
	+ » your name and address (city and state required); and
	+ » for mail orders write “MO” and for telephone orders write “TO” on the cardholder’s signature line.
* • do obtain proof of delivery of the goods or services to the address designated by the cardholder or, if the cardholder collects the goods or services in person, obtain an imprint of the card and the cardholder’s signature.
* • do notify the cardholder of delivery time frames and special handling and/or cancellation policies.
* • do ship goods within seven (7) days from the date on which authorization was obtained. If delays are incurred (for example, out of stock) after the order has been taken, notify the cardholder and obtain fresh authorization of the transaction.
* • do use any separate merchant identification numbers provided to you for Internet orders in all your requests for authorization and submission of charges.
* • do provide at least one (1) month’s prior written notice to your acquirer of any change in your Internet address.
### DON’TS 

* • don’t exceed the percentage of your total payment card volume for Card Not Present sales, as set out in your application.
* • don’t submit a transaction for processing until after the goods have been shipped or the service has been provided to the cardholder - the only exception to this is where the goods have been manufactured to the cardholder’s specifications and the cardholder has been advised of the billing details. don’t accept card account numbers by electronic mail.
* • don’t require a cardholder to complete a postcard or other document that displays the cardholder’s account number or card security code such as CVV2, CVC2, CAV2, and CID value in clear view when mailed or send any mailing to a cardholder that displays personal information in clear view.

It is also recommended that, if feasible, you obtain and keep a copy on file of the cardholder’s signature authorizing you to submit telephone and mail order transactions. 

Address Verification Service (AVS) (and other fraud mitigation tools such as Verified by Visa®, MasterCard® Secure Code, Card Validation Codes and Card Identification) does not guarantee against chargebacks; but, if used properly, it assists you in reducing the risk of fraud by confirming whether certain elements of the billing address provided by your customer match the billing address maintained by the card issuing bank. AVS also may help you avoid incurring additional interchange expenses. AVS is a separate process from obtaining an authorization and will provide a separate response. A transaction may be authorized regardless of the AVS response. It is your responsibility to monitor the AVS responses and use the information provided to avoid accepting high-risk transactions. 

If a disputed charge arises for a transaction conducted over the Internet or electronically, a chargeback may be exercised for the full amount.

## Interac® Debit Cards 

When accepting Interac® debit cards, you’ll need to follow the specific requirements set out by Interac® as well as the general requirements set out in this section. 

### DO’S 

### DON’TS 

* • have customer enter PIN as prompted by the terminal.
* • don’t process a credit card transaction in order to provide a refund on a debit card transaction.
* • don’t accept the PIN from the cardholder verbally or in written form.

You may offer cash back to your customers when they make a PIN debit card purchase. You may set a minimum and maximum amount of cash back that you will allow. If you are not currently offering this service, your POS device may require additional programming to begin offering cash back. 

You must reconcile your accounts for each location daily and notify us within 24 hours of any issues. 

An adjustment is a transaction that is initiated to correct a debit card transaction that has been processed in error. You are responsible for all adjustment and chargeback fees that may be charged by Interac®. 

An adjustment may be initiated for many reasons, including: 

* • The cardholder was charged an incorrect amount, whether too little or too much;
* • The cardholder was charged more than once for the same transaction;
* • A processing error may have occurred that caused the cardholder to be charged even though the transaction did not complete normally at the point of sale; or
* • A cardholder is disputing the goods or services provided.

### AUTHORIZATIONS 

Have your Merchant ID (MID) available before calling the AUTHORIZATION CENTER at 1-800-370-0466. 

Authorization via electronic devices 

* • You must obtain an authorization approval code for all transactions. You must also submit an authorization reversal if the authorization is no longer needed within 24 hours of the authorization.
* • A positive authorization response remains valid for the timeframe set out in section 19: TimeFrames.
* • An authorization approval code only indicates the availability of funds on an account at the time the authorization is requested. It does not indicate that the person presenting the card is the rightful cardholder, nor is it a promise or guarantee that you will not be subject to a chargeback and/or adjustment.
* • You must not attempt to obtain an authorization approval code from anyone other than us, unless we have authorized you to use a third party authorization system.
* • If you use Address Verification Services (AVS), you must review the AVS response separately from the authorization response and make your own decision about whether to accept the transaction. A transaction may receive an authorization approval code from the card issuing bank even if AVS is unavailable or reflects that the address provided to you does not match the billing address on file at the card issuing bank.
* • If you receive a referral response to an attempted authorization, you must not: 
	+ » submit the transaction without calling for and receiving a voice authorization; and
	+ » attempt another authorization on the same card through your POS device.
* • You must not attempt to obtain multiple authorizations for a single transaction. If a sale is declined, do not take alternative measures with the same card to obtain an approval of the sale from other authorization sources. Instead, request another form of payment.
* • If you fail to obtain an authorization approval code or if you submit a card transaction after receiving a decline (even if a subsequent authorization attempt results in an authorization approval code), your transaction may result in a chargeback and it may be assessed fines or fees by the payment organizations for which you will be responsible. Fees will vary based on your setup.
* • You will be charged for a request for an authorization approval code (where applicable), whether or not the transaction is approved.
* • For card present transactions, it is highly recommended that you use your electronic authorization device to swipe (magnetic stripe), tap/wave (contactless) or insert (chip) cards.

#### Card Not Present transactions 

It is highly recommended that you obtain the three digit card verification code on the back of the card (or the four digit verification code on the front of American Express cards) and that you include this code with each Card Not Present authorization request unless the transaction is a recurring transaction. 

Do not ask customers to provide CVV, CAV on paper forms. 

For recurring transactions, submit the card verification code only with the first authorization request and not with subsequent authorization requests. 

#### Authorization via telephone (other than terminal/electronic device users) 

* • You must call your designated Voice Authorization Toll Free Number and enter the authorization information into the VRU using a touch tone phone or hold for an authorization representative.
* • If the Voice Authorization Center asks you to obtain identification from the cardholder before issuing an approval code, you must clearly write the appropriate identification source and numbers in the space provided on the sales draft.
* • If the Voice Authorization Center asks you to confiscate a card, do not take any action that will alarm or embarrass the card presenter, and send the card to First Data Canada at 2630 Skymark Ave. Suite 500, Mississauga Ontario L4W 5A4.
* • If the sale is declined, please remember that our operators are only relaying a message from the card issuing bank. The fact that a sale has been declined must not be interpreted as a reflection of the cardholder’s creditworthiness. You must instruct the cardholder to call the card issuing bank. Authorization via electronic devices
* • If you use an electronic terminal to obtain authorization approval codes, you must obtain the authorization approval codes for all sales through this equipment.
* • If your terminal malfunctions, please refer to your Quick Reference Guide or call the POS Help Desk. Please remember to check your terminal periodically because most terminal problems are temporary in nature and are quickly corrected.
* • If a terminal is moved or if wires are disconnected, causing malfunction, call the POS Help Desk immediately and follow their instructions. You may be responsible for any service charges incurred for reactivation of the terminal.
* • Until the terminal becomes operable, you must call your designated Voice Authorization Toll Free Number and enter authorization information into the VRU using a touchtone phone. During this time, each transaction must be imprinted using a manual Imprinter machine. Third Party authorization systems 

Partial authorization provides an alternative to a declined transaction by permitting a card issuing bank to return an authorization approval for a partial amount. This amount is less than the transaction amount requested because the available card balance is not sufficient to approve the transaction in full. The cardholder is able to use the funds remaining on the card to pay for a portion of the purchase and select another form of payment (in other words, another payment card, cash, check) for the remaining balance of the transaction.
* • for MasterCard transactions, partial authorization is optional for batch authorized e-commerce transactions, mail order, telephone order transactions and recurring payment transactions.
* • for Discover transactions, partial authorization support is optional for Card Not Present transactions. If you support partial authorizations, a partial authorization indicator must be included in each authorization request.

An authorization expires or the merchant must complete at $0.00 if the Pre-Auth was completed via terminal or a Force Post if the Pre-Auth was completed over the phone. If you wish to support partial authorization functionality, you must contact Customer Service for additional rules and requirements.

## Settlements 

### Settle (Balance) Your Terminal Daily 

To help you avoid service disruptions, chargeback losses, additional fees and to help you maintain your cash flow please settle your terminal every day to ensure your account remains in good standing. Failure to settle your point-of-sale (POS) terminal or payment solution on a regular basis will result in expired transaction authorizations and puts your funds at risk and subject you to non-compliance fines. 

Keeping your system balanced (settled) also provides the following benefits: 

### • Maintain your Cash Flow: 

Transactions processed through your point-of-sale (POS) terminal or payment solution are not paid until your batch is settled. To have your transactions sent to First Data systemically at the end of each night and to ensure you’re being paid as quickly as possible, your POS should be set up to AUTOSETTLE. 

### • Avoid Additional Fees: 

Mastercard® and Visa® expect authorizations to be closed daily. When authorizations are not settled within 3 days, they qualify as a higher risk transaction and an additional surcharge is applied for late payments. 

### • Avoid Chargeback Losses: 

 The cardholder’s Issuing Bank has a right to issue a chargeback (reverse a sale) if the authorization is not settled within 7 days and 30 days for pre-authorized transfers. 

10 

## Special Types of Transactions 

### Payment by installments 

If a cardholder makes a deposit toward the full amount of the sale price and pays the balance on delivery, please follow the procedures set out in this section. 

### DO’S 

* • do execute two separate sales drafts and obtain an authorization for each sales draft on each transaction date; 
	+ » do indicate on each sales draft:
	+ » whether it is for the deposit or the balance of payment; and
	+ » the authorization date and approval code.
* • do submit and seek authorization of each delayed delivery transaction under the same merchant identification number and treat deposits on the card no differently than you treat deposits on all other payment products.
* • do complete Address Verification for each “balance” authorization.
* • do obtain proof of delivery upon delivery of the services/merchandise purchased.
### DON’TS 

* • don’t submit sales data to First Data relating to the “balance” until the goods have been completely delivered or the services fully provided.

If delivery occurs after the timeframes set out in the “Timeframes” on page 27, you must obtain a new authorization for the unprocessed portion of the transaction prior to delivery. If the transaction is declined, contact the cardholder and request another form of payment. 

For example: On January 1, a cardholder orders $2,200 worth of furniture and you receive an authorization for the full amount; however, only a $200 deposit is processed leaving a $2,000 balance remaining on the furniture. An authorization reversal must be processed for $2,000. When the goods are available to ship, the $2,000 transaction balance must be reauthorized. 

#### Advance payment charges 

If you permit or require cardholders to make advance payment charges for the following types of goods or services, please follow the procedures set out in this section: 

* • custom-orders (for example, orders for goods to be manufactured to a customer’s specifications);
* • ticketing for events or entertainment (for example, sporting events, or concerts);
* • tuition, room, board, and other mandatory fees (for example, library or other students services fees at universities);
* • tickets for airlines, rail lines, cruise lines, lodging, and other travel-related services (for example, tours or guided expeditions); and
* • vehicle rentals; or
* • in store merchandise not immediately available (for example, merchandise pre-purchased for an upcoming sale event or merchandise on layaway)

For all advance payment transactions: 

* • do state your full cancellation and refund policies;
* • do clearly disclose your intention to receive advance payment;
* • before you request an authorization, do obtain written consent from the cardholder to bill the card for an advance payment charge; The cardholder’s consent must include (1) a detailed description of the goods or services to be provided, and (2) his or her agreement to all of the terms of the sale (including price, any cancellation or refund policies), and the expected delivery date of the goods or services;
* • do obtain an authorization approval;
* • do complete a sales draft: and
* • if you cannot deliver the goods or services (for example, because custom-ordered merchandise cannot be fulfilled) and cannot make other arrangements, do immediately issue a credit for the full amount of the advance payment charge.

For Card Not Present transactions involving an advance payment: 

* • do ensure that the sales draft contains the words “Advance Payment”; and
* • within twenty-four (24) hours of the advance charge being authorized, do provide the cardholder with written confirmation (for example, by email or fax) that advance payment charge has been made, the written confirmation must include (1) a detailed description of the goods or services to be provided; (2) the amount of the charge; (3) the confirmation number (if applicable); (4) the details of any cancellation or refund policies; and (5) the expected delivery date of the goods or services.
#### Recurring transactions 

If you process recurring transactions and charge a cardholder’s account periodically for goods or services 

(for example, yearly subscriptions, annual membership fees, etc.), please follow the procedures set out in this section. 

### DO’S 

* • do obtain written cardholder approval for goods or services to be charged on a recurring basis to the cardholder’s account. Approval must at least specify: 
	+ - the cardholder’s name, address, account number and expiration date,
	+ - the transaction amounts,
	+ - the timing or frequency of recurring charges,
	+ - the duration of time for which the cardholder’s approval is granted, - for Discover Network transactions, the total amount of recurring charges to be billed to the cardholder’s account, (including taxes and tips) and your merchant identification number, and

* • don’t impose a finance charge in connection with the recurring transaction or preauthorized order.
* • don’t complete a recurring transaction after receiving a cancellation notice from the cardholder or card issuing bank or after a request for authorization has been denied.

It is highly recommended that you obtain the three digit card verification code on the back of the card (or the four digit verification code on the front of American Express cards), include the number with the first authorization request. This is not required for subsequent authorization requests. 

A positive authorization response for one recurring transaction is not a guarantee that any future recurring transaction authorization request will be approved or paid. 

If the recurring transaction is renewed, you must obtain from the cardholder a new written request for the continuation of such goods or services to be charged to the cardholder’s account. 

If you or we have terminated your right to accept cards, you must not submit authorization requests or sales data for recurring transactions that are due after the date of such termination.

	+ » a valid authorization code;
	+ » Merchant’s Doing Business As (“D/B/A”) name and location (city and province required) and Merchant Identification Number; and
* • if the card has a magnetic stripe and the POS device fails to read the magnetic stripe, or if you are required to obtain a voice authorization, you must also use a manual imprinting machine to make a clear impression of the card on the same side of the signed sales draft. If you work in the face-to-face sales environment, you may include the card verification code in the authorization request for US domestic key-entered transactions in lieu of taking a manual card imprint.
### DON’TS 

* • don’t include the card expiration date or any more than the last four digits of the card number in the copy of the sales draft which you provide to the cardholder.
* • when imprinting sales drafts, you must not alter the cardholder account number, circle or underline any information on the sales draft or alter a sales draft in any way after the transaction has been completed and signed.

* • do provide full refunds for the exact dollar amount of the original transaction including tax, handling charges, etc., and in no circumstances provide a refund amount for more than the original card sale amount;
* • do write clearly all amounts and other handwritten information - stray marks on the credit draft will render it illegible.
* • if the card cannot be swiped for any reason, do imprint the credit draft with the same card used by the cardholder to make the original purchase when applicable.
* • do ensure that the cardholder signs the credit draft, give the cardholder the appropriate copy, and deposit the credit draft immediately.
### DON’TS 

* • don’t circle or underline any information on the credit draft.

Your website must communicate your refund policy to your customers and require your customers to select a “click-to- accept” or other affirmative button to acknowledge the policy. The terms and conditions of the purchase must be displayed on the same screen view as the checkout screen that presents the total purchase amount, or within the sequence of website pages the cardholder accesses during the checkout process. 

For American Express transactions, please visit https://www.americanexpress.com/canada/. 

13 

## Exchanges 

For an even exchange, no additional paperwork is necessary and you may simply follow your standard company policy. 

For an uneven exchange, you must complete a credit draft, and follow the procedures outlined in the “Refunds” on page 16 for the total amount of the goods returned. The cardholder’s account will be credited for that amount. Then, complete a new sales draft for the total amount of any new goods purchased. 

14 

## Chargebacks, Retrievals and Other Debits 

### Chargebacks 

Both the cardholder and the card issuing bank have the right to question or dispute a transaction. If such questions or disputes are not resolved, a chargeback may occur. You are responsible for all chargebacks, our chargeback fees and related costs arising from your transactions. As a result, we will debit your settlement account or settlement funds for the amount of each chargeback. 

Due to the short time frames and the supporting documentation necessary to successfully (and permanently) reverse a chargeback in your favor, we strongly recommend that: 

* • you adhere to the guidelines and procedures outlined in this guide;
* • if you do receive a chargeback, investigate, and if you dispute the chargeback, submit the appropriate documentation within the required time frame;
* • whenever possible, contact the cardholder directly to resolve the dispute (except with respect to a Discover Network cardholder with whom direct contact regarding the dispute is prohibited by Discover Network Card Organization Rules);
* • If you have any questions or would like more informaiton, call Customer Service at 1-888-263-1938.

You must not process a credit transaction once a chargeback is received, even with cardholder authorization, as the credits may not be recoverable and you may be financially responsible for the credit as well as the chargeback. Instead, the card issuing bank will credit the cardholder’s account. 

### Chargeback process 

If the card issuing bank submits a chargeback, we will send you a chargeback notification, which may also include a request for transaction documentation. Due to the short time requirements imposed by the payment organizations, it is important that you respond to a chargeback notification and transaction documentation request within the time frame set out in the notification. 

Upon receipt of a transaction documentation request, you must immediately retrieve the requested sales draft(s) using the following guidelines: 

* • make a legible copy, centered on 8-1/2 x 11-inch paper (only one (1) sales draft per page);
* • write the ‘case number’ from the request for transaction documentation on each copy/page;
* • if applicable, make copies of a hotel folio, car rental agreement, mail/phone/Internet order form, or other form of receipt;
* • if a credit transaction has been processed, make a copy of the credit draft;
* • letters are not acceptable substitutes for sales drafts;
* • fax or mail legible copies of the sales draft(s) and credit drafts, if applicable, to the fax number or mail address provided on the request form;
* • if you fax your response, please (i) set your fax machine to print your fax number and name on the documents that you send, and (ii) set the scan resolution on your fax machine to the highest setting. We can use this information to help determine where the documentation received originated from if additional research is required, and the higher resolution setting improves the clarity of characters and graphics on the documentation transmitted and helps reduce the number of illegible fulfillments and/or chargebacks.

We strongly recommend that you also include a detailed rebuttal letter along with all pertinent documents when responding to a transaction request or a chargeback notification (for example, rental agreement, imprinted portion of the invoice or sales draft; the portion signed by the cardholder; and the area where the authorization codes, with amounts and dates, are located). 

If the information you provide is both timely and, in our sole discretion, sufficient to warrant a re-presentment of the transaction and/or reversal of the chargeback, we will do so on your behalf. However, re-presentment and/or reversal is/are ultimately contingent upon the card issuing bank and/or cardholder accepting the transaction under applicable payment organization guidelines. Re-presentment or reversal is not a guarantee that the chargeback has been resolved in your favor. 

If we do not receive a clear, legible and complete copy of the transaction documentation within the timeframe specified on the request, you may be subject to a chargeback for “non-receipt” for which there is no recourse. 

If you do not dispute the chargeback within the applicable time limits as set by the payment organization rules and regulations, you will forfeit your reversal rights. Our only alternative, which is available for Visa and MasterCard only, is to attempt a “good faith collection” from the card issuing bank on your behalf for non-fraud chargeback reason codes. This process can take up to six (6) months and must meet the card issuing bank’s criteria (for example, at or above a set dollar amount). Good faith collection attempts are not a guarantee that any funds will be collected on your behalf. Card issuing banks normally charge good faith collection fees, which are deducted from the transaction amount if accepted in addition to any processing fees that are charged by us. 

The card issuing bank may charge a handling fee which will be debited from your settlement account or settlement funds if a transaction documentation request results from a discrepancy between the sales draft and the transmitted record regarding any of the following: 

* • the name of your business;
* • the city, province, or country listed for your business;
* • the transaction date.

Visa: If we reverse the chargeback and re-present the transaction to the card issuing bank, the card issuing bank, at its sole discretion, may elect to submit the matter for arbitration before Visa. Visa currently charges a filing fee and a review fee. Whether or not a decision is made in your favor, you will be responsible for all such fees and charges and any other applicable fees and charges imposed by Visa. Such fees and charges will be debited from your settlement account or settlement funds, in addition to the chargeback. 

MasterCard: If we reverse the chargeback and re-present the transaction to the card issuing bank, the card issuing bank, at its sole discretion, may elect to resubmit the chargeback. In such event, at our discretion, we will debit your settlement account or settlement funds for the chargeback. However, if you feel strongly that it is an invalid chargeback, we may, on your behalf and at your request, submit the matter for arbitration before MasterCard. MasterCard currently charges a filing fee and a review fee. Whether or not a decision is made in your favor, you will be responsible for all such fees and charges, and any other charges imposed by MasterCard. Such fees and charges will be debited from your settlement account or settlement funds, in addition to the chargeback. 

Discover Network: If Discover Network rejects our re-presentment request and you feel strongly that the chargeback is invalid, we may, at our discretion and on your behalf and at your request, submit the matter for dispute arbitration before Discover Network. Discover Network charges acquirers fees for re-presentment requests and matters submitted to Discover Network for arbitration. We, in turn, may charge you fees for these items. 

#### CHARGEBACK REASONS 

The following section outlines the most common types of chargebacks. This list is not exhaustive. Within each group, we have included recommendations on how to reduce the risk of chargebacks. These are recommendations only, and do not guarantee that you will eliminate chargebacks. 

#### CHARGEBACKS DUE TO AUTHORIZATION

* • you must not exceed any predetermined thresholds for specific POS device types as specified by each payment organization.
* • you must ship goods within the timeframe set in the “Timeframes” on page 27, after you have obtained authorization.

#### CHARGEBACKS DUE TO CANCELLATION AND RETURNS 

Description: Credit was not processed properly or the cardholder has canceled and/or returned items. Likely scenario 

* • Cardholder received damaged or defective merchandise.
* • Cardholder continued to be billed for canceled recurring transaction.
* • Credit transaction was not processed. Recommendations to reduce risk of chargeback
* • issue credit to the cardholder on the same account as the purchase in a timely manner.
* • do not issue credit to the cardholder in the form of cash, cheque or in-store/merchandise credit as we may not be able to recoup your funds if the transaction is charged back.
* • for recurring transactions ensure customers are fully aware of the conditions: 
	+ »  cancel recurring transactions as soon as notification is received from the cardholder or as a chargeback, and issue the appropriate credit as needed to the cardholder in a timely manner; and
	+ »  notify the cardholder within 10 days (domestic) and 15 days (international) in advance of each billing, to allow the cardholder time to cancel the transaction.
* • provide proper disclosure of your refund policy for returned/canceled merchandise, or services to the cardholder at the time of transaction. Card present, cardholder signed the sales draft containing disclosure.

Description: Transactions that the cardholder claims are unauthorized; the account number is no longer in use or is fictitious, or the merchant was identified as “high risk.” 

NOTE: For Visa transactions, to ensure that you preserve your chargeback rights, you must: 

* • complete a retrieval request and/or provide a sales slip that contains all required data elements; and
* • respond to all retrieval requests with a clear legible copy of the transaction document that contains all required data elements within the specified timeframe.
### Likely scenario 

* • multiple transactions were completed with a single card without the cardholder’s permission.
* • a counterfeit card was used and proper acceptance procedures were not followed.
* • authorization was obtained; however, full track data was not transmitted.
* • the cardholder states that they did not authorize or participate in the transaction.

* • if you are utilizing an electronic device to capture card data, swipe, dip or wave all card transactions through your electronic authorization device to capture cardholder information. When applicable, ensure the displayed cardholder number matches the number on the card.
* • You should avoid keying the card data into your electronic authorization device unless you are unable to capture the card data through one of the above methods. If you do key the card data into your electronic authorization device, it is highly recommended that you also key in the three or four digit verification code. Otherwise, you should, imprint the card using a valid imprinting device that will capture the embossed card and merchant information. You must write on the manually imprinted draft all pertinent information relating to the transaction (transaction date, dollar amount, authorization code and merchandise description) and obtain the cardholder signature. Do not alter the imprint on the draft in any way. You are not protected from this type of chargeback by manually entering the information into the POS device. NOTE: Do not imprint on the back of a signed sales draft. The imprint must be on the transaction document that contains all transaction elements to prove the card was present at the time of the transaction.
* • Obtain the cardholder signature for all transactions; ensure the signature on the sales draft matches the signature on the back of the card.
* • Process all transactions one time and do not batch out transactions multiple times.
* • Educate staff on procedures to eliminate point of sale (POS) fraud.

* • obtain authorization for all transactions.
* • ensure merchant descriptor matches the name of the business and is displayed correctly on the cardholder statement.
* • ensure descriptor includes correct business address and a valid Customer Service number.

## Suspect/Fraudulent Transactions 

If the card being presented or the behavior of the person presenting the card appears to be suspicious or you otherwise suspect fraud, you must immediately call the Voice Authorization Center and ask to speak to a Code 10 operator. Answer all their questions and follow their instructions. 

While not proof that a transaction is fraudulent, the following are some suggestions to assist you in preventing fraudulent transactions that could result in a chargeback: 

### Does the cardholder: 

* • appear nervous/agitated/hurried?
* • appear to be making indiscriminate purchases (for example, does not care how much an item costs, the size, etc.)?
* • make purchases substantially greater than your usual customer (for example, your average transaction is $60, but this transaction is for $360)?
* • insist on taking the merchandise immediately (for example, no matter how difficult it is to handle, is not interested in free delivery, alterations, etc.)?
* • appear to be purchasing an unusual amount of expensive items or the same items?
* • take an unusual amount of time to sign the sales draft, or look at the back of the card as he signs?
* • talk fast or carry on a conversation to distract you from checking the signature?
* • take the card from a pocket instead of a wallet?
* • repeatedly come back, in a short amount of time or right before closing time, to make additional purchases?
* • cause an unusual, sudden increase in the number and average sales transactions over a one-to three-day period?
* • tell you he has been having some problems with his card issuing bank and request that you call a number (that he provides) for a “special” handling or authorization?
* • have a previous history of disputed charges?
* • place orders to be shipped to an address other than the billing address, or use anonymous/ free email domains?
* • place orders sent to zip codes or countries where you show a history of fraudulent claims?
### Does the card: 

* • have characters the same size, height, style and all within alignment?
* • appear to be re-embossed (the original numbers or letters may be detected on the back of the card)?
* • have a damaged hologram?
* • have a Magnetic Stripe on the back on the card?
* • have an altered signature panel (for example, appear discolored, glued or painted, or show erasure marks on the surface)?
* • have “valid from” (effective) and “valid thru” (expiration) dates consistent with the sale date?

We also recommend that you are vigilant for any cardholder who behaves as follows, specifically in relation to prepaid cards: 

* • frequently makes purchases and then returns the goods for cash;
* • uses prepaid cards to purchase other prepaid cards;
* • uses large numbers of prepaid cards to make purchases.

Gift Cards, jewelry, video, stereo, computer and camera equipment, shoes and men’s clothing are typically fraud-prone because they can easily be resold. Also be suspicious of high dollar amounts and transactions with more than one fraudprone item (for example, two laptops, three gold chains, etc.).

Pre-authorization for Travel & Entertainment (T&E) and restaurant merchants 

If you are a business engaged in providing travel and/or entertainment services (for example, car rentals, hotels, motels, etc.) or a restaurant business, and engage in the practice of “pre-authorization” you must comply with the following general procedures: 

* • a hotel, motel, or car rental merchant may obtain an estimated authorization at the time of check-in.
* • restaurants must not add an estimated tip amount to the authorization request beyond the value of the goods provided, or services rendered, plus any applicable tax.
* • you must notify the cardholder of the dollar amount you intend to “Pre-Authorize”.
* • if the customer decides to use another form of payment (for example, cash, check, etc.) you must promptly call the Voice authorization Response Unit to delete the authorization hold. Provide the cardholder’s account number, original dollar amount and date of the transaction, and the authorization code. If a new transaction takes place, a new imprinted and signed sales draft for the exact amount and a new authorization code for that amount must be obtained.
* • VEHICLE RENTAL PROVIDERS MAY NOT INCLUDE POTENTIAL VEHICLE DAMAGE OR INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLES IN ANY PREAUTHORIZATIONS.
* • if you receive a decline on a transaction, you must wait twenty-four (24) hours before attempting to reauthorize. If you reauthorize prior to this time frame and receive an approval, you may be subject to a chargeback and a fine imposed by the payment organizations.
* • hotels, motels, and car rental merchants are allowed up to a 15% variance above the amount authorized. If the final amount charged to the cardholder exceeds the original estimate by more than 15% above the preauthorization, you must authorize any additional amounts, and all incremental authorization codes must be written in the authorization area along with the date of authorization and the amount authorized.
* • pre-authorization for certain establishments services, are allowed up to a 20% (instead of 15%) variance above the amount authorized. If the final amount exceeds the amount “preauthorized” by more than 20%, you must authorize the additional amount. Estimating the authorization amount to include a tip is prohibited. The authorization request must include only the amount associated with the bill presented to your customer.
* • you must obtain an authorization for the initial estimated charges and then monitor the charges to ensure that the actual charges made do not exceed the estimated charges. If the actual charges exceed the amount of the initial estimated authorization (and any subsequent estimated authorizations), then you must secure a positive authorization for the additional amount. Subsequent authorizations must only be for the additional amount of total charges, and must not include any amounts already authorized.
* • the estimated amount of any pre-authorization for lodging accommodations must be based on 
	+ » (i) the intended length of stay; (ii) the room rate; (iii) applicable taxes and service charges; and (iv) other miscellaneous charges as dictated by experience.
